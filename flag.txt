 git checkout :
Checks out a different branch – switches branches by updating the index, working tree, and HEAD to reflect the chosen branch. Example: git checkout newbranch

 git branch :
Lists existing branches, including remote branches if ‘-a’ is provided. Creates a new branch if a branch name is provided.

 git status :
Shows you the status of files in the index versus the working directory. It will list out files that are untracked (only in your working directory), modified (tracked but not yet updated in your index), and staged (added to your index and ready for committing).
